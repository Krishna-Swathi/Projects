Project Outline and Goal
The main objective of this project was to analyze the impact of commodity price fluctuations—specifically crude oil, gold, and natural gas—on stock market performance, focusing on indices such as the S&P 500. The problem being addressed is the need to understand the relationship between commodity prices and stock markets, which is crucial for investors and analysts in making informed decisions.
The goal of this project is to build a data pipeline that automates the process of retrieving daily updated data from the S&P 500, correlating it with real-time commodity price data, and performing analysis to uncover any patterns or dependencies between these two data sources.

Tools and technologies used for this project
Python for data extraction, cleaning, and analysis.
SQLite as the database to store processed data.
Power BI and matplotlib for final data visualization.
Apache Airflow for automating the ETL pipeline.
Google Colab as the platform for development
